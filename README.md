uh i kinda feel like coding 2048 i guess
should be a quick project - i give this 2 weeks of serious effort

## day 1
- create repo + first files

## day 2
- create grid
- make methods to add, combine cells
- change to make cells a dictionary
- begin to implement move left (press left key)
- consider changing implementation of tiles to set / multiply instead of add

- changed my mind again on how to implement this
- make a list of all the tiles in the row (not including spaces)
- combine all pairs
- return new list as row

- probably should add typeErrors at some point
- ong probably woulda been better to just use numpy arrays but hey we're here now

- eod: now has a move-left function and a repr
- further plans: implement movement in other directions, automagically adding new tiles, clean up code
- next steps: add actual controls and potentially a score? then it's just ui work

## day 3 (short day)
